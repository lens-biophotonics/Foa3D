.. _format:

Microscopy image format
-----------------------
The Foa3D tool accepts as input 3D RGB or grayscale image stacks in TIF/TIFF or NumPy format.
Alternatively, a .yml stitch file generated by the ZetaStitcher tool for large volumetric stack alignment and stitching
[`ZetaStitcher GitHub <https://github.com/lens-biophotonics/ZetaStitcher>`_]
may be also provided. This .yml file can be generated following the detailed documentation available at
[`ZetaStitcher Documentation <https://lens-biophotonics.github.io/ZetaStitcher/>`_]
from a collection of 3D stacks composing a tiled mesoscopic image of a brain tissue sample.
In detail, the Foa3D tool employs the 3D stack alignment information included in the .yml file
to programmatically access and process basic image sub-volumes,
thus enabling the analysis of high-resolution microscopy reconstructions
of considerable size even on low-resource machines.
The .yml and the image stack files must be located within the same directory.

.. code-block:: console

   $ python -m foa3d zetastitch.yml

.. _resolution:

Microscopy image resolution
---------------------------
The values (in μm) of the lateral and longitudinal pixel size should be specified via CLI,
along with the full width at half maximum of the optical system's point spread function:

.. code-block:: console

   $ ... --px-size-xy 0.4 --px-size-z 1 --psf-fwhm-x 1.5 --psf-fwhm-y 1.4 --psf-fwhm-z 3.1

This information is employed at the preprocessing stage of the pipeline to isotropize the image spatial resolution,
by blurring the coronal XY-plane of the sliced microscopy sub-volumes;
two-photon scanning and light-sheet fluorescence microscopes are indeed characterized by a poorer resolution
along the direction of the optical axis: if not properly corrected, this anisotropy would then introduce
a systematic bias in the resulting 3D fiber orientations. 

.. _frangi:

Frangi filter configuration
---------------------------
Fiber enhancement is achieved via a multiscale 3D Frangi filter [`Frangi, et al., 1998 <https://doi.org/10.1007/BFb0056195>`_].
The spatial scales of the filter (in μm) can be provided via the ``-s/--scales`` option.
As discussed in [`Sorelli, et al., 2023 <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-30953-w>`_],
the optimal scales which best preserve the original intensity
and cross-sectional size of the 3D tubular structures present in the analized images
correspond to half of their expected radius.
The Frangi filter is also characterized by three sensitivity parameters, α, β, and γ.
In detail, lower α values tend to amplify the response of the filter to the presence of elongated structures,
whereas an increase in β determines a relatively higher sensitivity to blob-shaped structures.
Usually, the α and β sensitivity parameters are heuristically fixed for the specific application
or image modality of interest:
the default values, namely ``α=0.001`` and ``β=1``, were shown to lead to a marked selective enhancement of
tubular fiber structures, and to a considerable rejection of the cell soma in two-photon fluorescence microscopy images.
Whereas α and β are linked to grey-level-invariant geometrical features,
the γ sensitivity is related to the image contrast:
if not specified by the user, this parameter is automatically set to half of the maximum Hessian norm computed
at each spatial scale of interest.
In the example below, the Frangi filter is tuned for fibers having a cross-sectional diameter of 5 and 10 μm,
with an automatic contrast sensitivity:

.. code-block:: console

   $ ... -a 0.001 -b 10 -s 1.25 2.5

.. _parallelization:

Parallelization
---------------
In order to speed up the fiber orientation analysis on large brain tissue sections, the Foa3D pipeline divides
the input image reconstruction into basic slices of suitable shape, and feeds them to separate concurrent workers.
By default, Foa3D will use all available logical cores, splitting the multiscale fiber enhancement among parallel
threads - e.g., 16 image slices will be simultaneously processed at 2 spatial scales of interest on a 32-core CPU.
The size of these slices is automatically set depending on the currently available RAM.
The ``--job`` and ``--ram`` options may be otherwise specified via CLI in order to limit the employed resources:

.. code-block:: console

   $ ... --jobs 8 --ram 32

.. _somamask:

Soma rejection
--------------
A neuronal soma fluorescence channel may be optionally provided to the Foa3D tool,
in order to improve the specificity of the fiber orientation maps
achieved thanks to the inherent attenuation of non-tubular objects offered by the Frangi filter.
This is performed via a postprocessing step which further suppresses neuronal bodies
using Yen's automatic thresholding algorithm.
The enhanced neuronal body rejection may be activated via the ``-n/--neuron-mask`` option modifying,
if required, the default channel related to the soma fluorescence:

.. code-block:: console

   $ ... -n --ch-fiber 0 --ch-neuron 1

.. _odf:

Orientation distribution functions
----------------------------------
High-resolution fiber orientation data obtained at the native pixel size of the imaging system can be integrated into 
orientation distribution functions (ODFs), providing a comprehensive statistical description
of 3D fiber tract orientations within larger spatial compartments or super-voxels.
ODFs are highly suitable for a multimodal quantitative comparison with spatial fiber architectures
mapped by other high-resolution optical modalities, as 3D-Polarized Light Imaging
[`Axer, et al., 2016 <https://doi.org/10.3389/fnana.2016.00040>`_].
Furthermore, the spatial downscaling produced by the ODF estimation allows to bridge the gulf between the meso-
and macro-scale connectomics that is generally targeted by diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI).
The Foa3D tool features the generation of fiber ODFs from the 3D orientation vector fields returned by
the Frangi filtering stage via the fast analytical approach described in
[`Alimi, et al., 2020 <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2020.101760>`_].
Alimi's method is computationally efficient and is characterized by improved angular precision and resolution
with respect to deriving the ODFs by modeling local directional histograms of discretized fiber orientations.
The multiscale estimation of fiber ODFs may be enabled by providing a list of super-voxel sides (in μm) via
the ``-o/--odf-res`` option:

.. code-block:: console

   $ ... --odf-res 25 50

The Foa3D tool also provides the possibility to directly repeat the fiber ODFs estimation,
skipping the Frangi filtering stage, if a pre-computed fiber orientation vector map is feeded as input
in place of the raw microscopy image reconstruction. NumPy and HDF5 files are both supported:

.. code-block:: console

   $ python -m foa3d.py fiber_vec.h5 --odf-res 100

The fiber ODFs returned by the Foa3D tool may be accessed using the open source MRtrix3 software package
for medical image processing and visualization
[`Tournier, et al., 2019 <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116137>`_].
