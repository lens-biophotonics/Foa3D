Welcome to Foa3D's documentation!
=================================

**Foa3D** (3D Fiber Orientation Analysis) is a Python tool for multiscale nerve
fiber enhancement and 3D orientation analysis in large high-resolution image
volumes acquired by two-photon scanning or light-sheet fluorescence microscopy.

Key features
------------
* parallel multiscale fiber enhancement and segmentation
* efficient multiscale fiber orientation distribution functions
* able to handle large tiled microscopy reconstructions
